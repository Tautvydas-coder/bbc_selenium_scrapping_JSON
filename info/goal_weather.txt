The Goal:
Create the JSON file:

File format:
{
   DayOfTheWeek: {
      City: {
         Vilnius: {
             Monday: 23,
             Tuesday: 24,
             Wednesday: 25,
         },
         Kaunas: {
             Monday: 23,
             Tuesday: 24,
             Wednesday: 25,
         },
         Klaipeda: {
             Monday: 23,
             Tuesday: 24,
             Wednesday: 25,
         }
      }
   }
}

We will use the url:
https://www.bbc.com/weather
and Selenium as page parser.
You need to create the script that will open the URL,
Input in the field Three different Cities (you could choose
any you wish)(It could be the cities of your next trip or any)
Then You need to grab the temperature for the nearest 3 days
and grab the information in the Dict described here
then you need to save all this to the json file
The result of this job should be the Python script as a source
and the ouput json file
